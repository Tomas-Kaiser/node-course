# JavaScript Course

NodeJS is an open-source & runtime environment for excuting Javascript code outside of the browser. NodeJS is mostly used for building a backend apps (API). It is very <b>superfast</b> and highly scalable (faster than java).

<b>Architecture of the NodeJS</b>

We are using JS engine to convert JS code into machine code for eg. Firefox using SpiderMonkey, Chrome using V8 engine. The node is an runtime environment using V8 engine. Node has different object such as `http.creatServer()`, `fs.readFile()` etc. wherease in browser we have document (`document.getElementById('')`) object.

<b>How Node Works</b>

Node is fast because it is non-blocking or asynchronous nature of Node. Single Thread serves all requests. All other framework as Rail, NET.ASP are synchronous and therefore they need to use many threads to do same work. 

<b>Installing Node</b>

Let's see if you are already installed Node with running `node --version` in your terminal.

If not go to https://nodejs.org/en/ and download the NodeJs to your computer based on you OS.
